	  Linux 2.6.28 and later
	lcd-console.c
	- rationalized and optimized lcd-console program
	hd44780.c
	- introduced BF_CHECK statistics for optimization purposes

- version 0.13.8	2009-06-15
	lcd-linux.c:
	- implemented CGRAM buffering.
	- added support for modified linux 2.6.27 sys filesystem:
	  device_create() had its prototype changed.
	- avoided NULL pointer dereferences in do_lcd_ioctl().
	- DECOM mode implemented: ESC [ ? 6 h and ESC [ ? 6 l.
	- improved read behavior when the driver does not

	- implemented the LCDL_IOATTR ioctl to read from/write to
	  the char device including or excluding attributes
	  in the same way as /dev/vcs and /dev/vcsa.
	hd44780.c:
	- added proc file to display the bitmap of cgram characters.
	- refined CGRAM buffering.
	- simplified and rationalized wiring configuration scheme.
	- the cgram_buffer is now shared between lcd-linux layer
	  and the display driver through the driver struct.
	global:
	- documentation updated.

- version 0.13.6	2009-01-17
	- simplified and optimized the hd44780 driver.
	- fixed a driving bug in the hd44780 driver visible on
	  displays with more than one controller onboard.

	- optimized and inlined __memset_short() and __memcpy_short() 
	  functions.
	- lcd_memset() and lcd_memmove() are no longer exported and 
	  replaced by two ioctls LCDL_MEMSET and LCD_MEMMOVE.

- version 0.13.2	2008-03-25
	- improved documentation.
	- improved lcdcon module.
	- minor changes to follow Linux 2.6.24 changes.
	- changed lcd_read/write() prototypes; now they take a void * pointer
	  as a read/write buffer and an additional argument is required to 
	  specify whether the buffer is a short * or a char * (i.e. 
	  whether data includes attributes or not).
	- fixed a bug that prevented attributes from being rendered.
	- added module autoloading capability.

- version 0.13.0	2008-01-04

	  sequence to set the scroll region.
	- documentation updated.
	- removed the test_module.c source in the examples directory.
	- removed the frames member in the lcd_parameters struct.

- version 0.12.6	2007-09-29

	  console driver for lcd displays using the lcd-linux interface.
	- lcd_memset() and lcd_memmove() functions are now exported.
	- optimized read/write strategy in the hd44780 driver to take
	  into account check-busy-flag/busy-waiting and 4/8 bit options.
	- bug fixed in lcd-linux; when the driver does not provide its
	  own charmap and lcd-linux provides one, a driver reset resulted
	  in an invalid charmap.
	- improved goto_xy() behavior.
	- corrected scroll behavior.
	- made lcd_read() and lcd_write uninterruptible.
	- documentation updated.

- version 0.12.5	2007-05-12
	- kernel interface changed; now the lcd_struct pointer describing 
	  each device is stored in the file struct.
	- implemented the ESC [ ... h and ESC [ ... l escape sequences.
	- documentation updated.
	- fixed a serious buffer overflow in proc_fb_read() in lcd-linux.c.
	- removed the ESC S escape sequence.
	- improved VT102 emulation; implemented need_wrap and
	  insert mode.
	- fixed a bug in the hd44780 driver in handling displays
	  with more than one controller onboard; thanks to Dennis Kerrisk
	  for pointing out this bug.
	- implemented lcd_driver_setup() in lcd-linux.h; modified
	  the hd44780 and example drivers accordingly.

- version 0.12.1	2007-02-25
	- replaced read_display() and write_display() macros
	  with equivalent functions.
	- fixed a bug in the hd44780 driver regarding cursor repositioning
	  in displays with less than 40 columns.
	- added sysfs support for 2.6 kernel (for udev usage).

- version 0.12.0	2007-01-09
	- fixed a bug in the hd44780 driver in the 4 bit bus support.
	- lcd_unregister_driver() prototype changed; now it takes both
	  a pointer to the driver struct and the lcd parameter struct.
	- the lcd_drivers array is now implemented as a doubly linked list;
	  this allows to save one kmalloc allocation wich results in memory
	  saving; moreover there is no longer memory waste for unused minor
	  numbers; find_lcd_struct() and list_add_sorted() were introduced.
	- fixed some race conditions.
	- introduced semaphores for concurrent execution.
	- implemented dynamic charmap allocation.
	- removed the new ESC N and ESC P escape sequences to switch to
	  the next and previous frame respectively; definitely a bad idea.
	- simplified and inlined the ugly fb_limits function; improved scrup()
	  and scrdown().
	- implemented smart functions to keep the cursor in the visible screen
	  area.
	- lcd_drivers is now allocated using kmalloc instead of vmalloc.
	- implemented many (almost paranoid) sanity checks on the functions and
	  parameter of the driver.
	- removed the fb_end field from the struct lcd_struct; renamed fb_start
	  into fb_base; now the used area is assumed to be the whole
	  framebuffer.
	- changed the behavior of ESC A and ESC B, scroll up and scroll down
	  sequences; now these sequences take a parameter which is the number of
	  lines to scroll; improved behavior close to the framebuffer
	  boundaries.
	- MOST IMPORTANT!!! Due to the introduction of the virtual screen, the
	  offset range now only refers to the display panel; all CGRAM and
	  charmap operations are now implemented using ioctls.
	- implemented the new ESC N and ESC P escape sequences to switch to the
	  next and previous frame respectively.
	- implemented the new ESC C sequence to move the visible screen area
	  within the frame.
	- implemented a reasonable behavior for backspace across frame
	  boundaries.

- version 0.11.0	2006-11-12
	- BROKEN!!!! Don't use!
	- improved scroll and backspace behavior
	- removed the HD44780_RAW_CMD ioctl; it is not a good
	  idea to directly pass commands to the display controller.
	- removed hd44780_handle_custom_write() and
	  hd44780_handle_custom_ioctl() functions; no longer needed.
	- introduced the virtual screen abstraction to emulate
	  virtually any console size.
	- extended the hd44780 driver to support up to 7 controllers.
	- changed iterator_dec().
	- changed read_char() and read_data(); now they return a void and
	  the character being read is passed via an unsigned char pointer.
	- documentation updated.
	- modified read_display() macro in hd44780.c.
	- changed escape behavior in lcd-linux.c; there are no more
	  esc states; the esc character is written in the struct_flags.

- version 0.10.2	2006-07-02
	- the assigned minor number can be specified when
	  loading the module.
	- improved init/cleanup functions.
	- fixed a bug in the IOCTL_SET_PARAM ioctl.

	- backward read/write is now usable, no longer
	  experimental.
	- removed useless fields in lcd_struct.
	- implemented smart backspace() and tab().
	- CSI escape sequences are now enabled only
	  in forward read/write mode
	- _Completely_ rewritten the console emulation, now being
	  very similar to the Linux console.
	- improved lcd_mempcy() and lcd_memset() functions.
	- fixed a design error in the implementation of the handling of
	  four lines LCDs

	- rationalized handling of control characters.
	- fixed a timing issue in the hd44780 driver

- version 0.9.0		2005-08-23
	- this is the first version of the two separate pieces of
	  software: lcd-linux (the software layer) and the hardware driver
	  (only the hd44780 is presently available); other drivers for
	  different controllers may be easily written following the skeleton
	  file in the drivers/skeleton directory;
