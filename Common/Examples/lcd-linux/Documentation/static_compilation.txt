1. Static compilation into the kernel
=====================================

To statically compile the driver into the kernel the following operations must
be performed. I will assume the kernel sources to be in "/usr/src/linux" on
an i386 architecture:

1) in the main LCD-Linux directory do a "make source_install" as root and change
to the new directory "/usr/src/linux/drivers/lcd-linux"



2) rename the appropriate Makefile-2.x to "Makefile"; the available files are:
- Makefile-2.2: suitable for 2.2 and 2.0 kernels
- Makefile-2.4: suitable for 2.4 kernels
- Makefile-2.6: suitable for 2.6 kernels



3)
- Linux 2.0.x, 2.2.x, 2.4.x:
edit "/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/config.in" and add the following line at the
end of the file:

source drivers/lcd-linux/Config.in

- Linux 2.6.x:
edit "/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/Kconfig" and add the following line at the end
of the file:

source "drivers/lcd-linux/Kconfig"



4)
- Linux 2.0.x and 2.2.x:
edit "/usr/src/linux/drivers/Makefile" and add the following lines BEFORE the
line "include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make":

ifdef CONFIG_LCD_LINUX
SUB_DIRS += lcd-linux
MOD_SUB_DIRS += lcd-linux
ALL_SUB_DIRS += lcd-linux
endif

- Linux 2.4.x:
edit "/usr/src/linux/drivers/Makefile" and add the following lines BEFORE the
line "include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make":

mod-subdirs			+= lcd-linux
subdir-$(CONFIG_LCD_LINUX)	+= lcd-linux

- Linux 2.6.x:
edit "/usr/src/linux/drivers/Makefile" and add the following line at the end of
the file:

obj-$(CONFIG_LCD_LINUX)		+= lcd-linux/



5)
- Linux 2.0.x and 2.2.x:
edit "/usr/src/linux/Makefile" and locate the block of "DRIVERS" statements;
among those statements add the following lines:

ifeq ($(CONFIG_LCD_LINUX),y)
DRIVERS := $(DRIVERS) drivers/lcd-linux/lcd.o
endif

- Linux 2.4.x:
edit "/usr/src/linux/Makefile" and locate the block of "DRIVERS" statements;
among those statements add the following one:

DRIVERS-$(CONFIG_LCD_LINUX) += drivers/lcd-linux/lcd.o

- Linux 2.6.x:
no need to modify "/usr/src/linux/Makefile"



6) configure your kernel following the usual procedure

To compile the driver as a module you can simply do a "make clean install" as
root in the main directory. Of course if you prefer you can also include the
driver sources in your kernel sources and compile it as a module through the
standard procedure, but why doing all this job ?
