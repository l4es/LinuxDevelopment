1. Configuration and compilation
================================

In order to compile LCD-Linux you need a full distribution of the kernel
sources. The sources must be configured, so if you just downloaded a fresh
kernel source package, remember to unpack it, do a "make xconfig" and compile a
new kernel. Some include files will be created in the right places, reflecting
your current configuration.

This module has been extensively tested under Linux 2.2.x, 2.4.x and 2.6.x
without any problem. It compiles and probably works on Linux 2.0.x but I
haven't tested it.



2. Module Parameters
====================

The module supports the following parameters.

 +--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
 | minors	| Maximum number of possible drivers.			|
 |		| Default : 8		(1 - 256)			|
 +--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+



3. Boot command line parameters (not available under Linux 2.0)
===============================

When the driver is statically compiled into the kernel, the above parameter can
be passed at boot time.

lcd=minors

Examples:
To allocate a maximum of 10 drivers:
	lcd=10



4. Recognized control characters and escape sequences
=====================================================

-- Standard control characters:

 +-------+--------------+-----------------------+
 | ASCII | Symbol	| Character		|
 +-------|--------------+-----------------------+

 |  0x09 | HT (\t) ^I	| Tab			|
 |  0x0a | LF (\n) ^J	| Newline (line feed)	|
 |  0x0b | VT (\v) ^K	| Vertical tab		|
 |  0x0c | FF	   ^L	| Newpage (form feed)	|
 |  0x0d | CR (\r) ^M	| Carriage return	|
 |  0x1b | ESC	   ^[	| Escape		|
 |  0x7f | DEL	     	| Delete		|
 |  0x9b | CSI	   ^[[	| Equivalent to ESC [	|

-- ECMA-48 escape sequences:

	(from the console_codes manpage)

       CSI  (or  ESC  [) is followed by a sequence of parameters, at most NPAR
       (16), that are decimal numbers separated by  semicolons.  An  empty  or
       absent  parameter  is taken to be 0 or 1 as the case may be.
       The sequence of parameters may be preceded by a single question mark.

       The action of a CSI sequence is determined by its final character.

       @   ICH       Insert the indicated # of blank characters.
       A   CUU       Move cursor up the indicated # of rows.

       g   TBC       Without parameter: clear tab stop at the current position.
       n   DSR       Status report.
       q   DECLL     Set keyboard LEDs.


-- Custom escape sequences:

	ESC A	Scroll up the display content (requires arguments; see below)
	ESC B	Scroll down the display content (requires arguments; see below)
	ESC C	Browse the virtual screen (requires arguments; see below)
	ESC G	Enter graphic mode; (requires arguments; see below)
	ESC r	Decrement address counter after data read/write (requires
		arguments; see below)
	ESC s	User defined character select (requires arguments; see below)


-- Arguments:

	ESC A	requires one argument;
		the number of lines to scroll;
		example:
		to scroll 2 lines up
		echo -en '\033A\2' > /dev/lcd
		Note that \2 means ascii code 2, not character 2 which has
		ascii code 50;

	ESC B	requires one argument;
		the number of lines to scroll;
		example:
		to scroll 2 lines down
		echo -en '\033B\2' > /dev/lcd
		Note that \2 means ascii code 2, not character 2 which has
		ascii code 50;

	ESC C	requires one argument;
		the direction to move the visible area in the virtual screen;
		'1' = Up
		'2' = Down
		'3' = Left
		'4' = Right
		example:
		to go up
		echo -en '\033C1' > /dev/lcd
		to go left
		echo -en '\033C3' > /dev/lcd

	ESC G	requires one argument;
		the argument is interpreted as a cgram character and must have
		code between [cgram_char0, cgram_char0+cgram_chars-1];
		example:
		on the hd44780 we have
		[cgram_char0, cgram_char0+cgram_chars-1] = [0, 7]

		echo -en '\033G\0' > /dev/lcd	is the first cgram character
		echo -en '\033G\7' > /dev/lcd	is the last cgram character

		to print both characters with a single command
		echo -en '\033G\0\033G\7' > /dev/lcd;
		With this feature in no way cgram characters can interfere with
		control characters.
		If the argument is not in the appropriate range, it is
		interpreted as a normal character and treated accordingly
		example:
		echo -en '\033Ga' > /dev/lcd
		is equivalent to
		echo -en 'a' > /dev/lcd
		echo -en '\033G\n' > /dev/lcd
		is equivalent to
		echo -en '\n' > /dev/lcd

	ESC r	requires one argument; '1' = on; '0' = off
		example:
		echo -en '\033r1' > /dev/lcd
		will activate the reverse input/output mode.
		In this mode CSI escape sequences are disabled.

	ESC s	requires 'cgram_bytes+1' arguments
		(see the lcd_parameters struct below);
		the first argument is the slot number of the new user defined
		character; the subsequent arguments are the bitmap of the new
		character
		example:
		on the hd44780 we have
		[cgram_char0, cgram_char0+cgram_chars-1] = [0, 7]
		cgram_bytes = 8
		then:
		echo -en '\033s\001\000\001\003\026\011\002\020\010' > /dev/lcd
		will define the second user defined character


Other escape sequences are passed to the display driver calling the
handle_custom_char() function (if defined).

-- User defined characters

User defined characters have codes from cgram_char0 to
cgram_char0+cgram_chars-1.



5. Offset mapping
=================

	Reading and writing:
	(reading requires a bidirectional parallel port)

	[0, (vs_cols*vs_rows)-1]	The virtual screen

display panel range:
- Each time an offset is read or written, the offset is incremented or
decremented according to the number of bytes written or read.



6. Proc filesystem
==================

If you have a 2.2.0 or later Linux kernel, the module will create a
directory /proc/lcd/. In this directory you will find the following files:

- drivers:	a list of registered display drivers.

A directory for each registered driver; in this directory you will find:

- framebuffer:	the ring framebuffer content.

- display:	an image of the display content.

- charmap.h:	an include file with the current character map; useful if you
		have your own character substitutions and you don't want them
		to get lost when you unload the module; then you can recompile
		the driver with your own character map using charmap.h as a
		normal include file



7. Examples
===========

In the "examples" directory there are examples (test_*.c) on how to read, write
and manipulate this device. To compile them type "make test" in the main
directory.



8. Developers
=============

To develop your own modules or kernel parts using this driver, just include the
"lcd-linux.h" header file in the "include/linux" directory. This header defines
the function prototypes of the interface as well as the ioctls. You must also
include the header of the driver for which you are developing.

NOTE: The adjective "external" refers to other routines in kernel space using
module's capabilities. Obviously no program in user space can directly access
these routines. Hence, "external" must be intended as "in kernel but not in
the lcd-linux module".

Available functions for external use:
- int lcd_register_driver(struct lcd_driver *driver, struct lcd_parameters *par)
	do the following three actions:
	(1) register the driver described by the "driver" struct with parameters
	    in the "par" struct, in the table of lcd drivers;
	(2) initialize the communication port between computer and display;
	    initialize the display;
	(3) create a directory with the driver's name in /proc/lcd (if the proc
	    filesystem is supported) with the "framebuffer", "display" and
	    "charmap.h" files;
	return 0 on success;
	return a negative errno code on failure;
	after this function has successfully returned the device is fully
	operative.

- int lcd_unregister_driver(struct lcd_driver *driver, struct lcd_parameters *par)
	do the following three actions:
	(1) unregister the driver described by the "driver" struct with
	    parameters in the "par" struct, in the table of lcd drivers;
	(2) reset the display;
	    reset the communication port between computer and display;
	(3) delete the /proc/lcd/"drivername" entry with the "framebuffer",
	    "display" and "charmap.h" files; any proc file created by the lcd
	    driver is not deleted; it is up to the cleanup function of the
	    driver to delete its own proc files before calling
	    lcd_unregister_driver();
	return 0 on success;
	return a negative errno code on failure;

- int lcd_open(unsigned short minor, struct lcd_struct **pp)
	open the device with minor number 'minor' and return the  pointer to the
	lcd_struct associated with that minor number in *pp; this pointer is to
	be passed to all subsequent lcd_...() functions;
	returns 0 on success;
	returns a negative errno code on failure;

-int lcd_close(struct lcd_struct **pp)
	close the device previously opened by lcd_open(), described by the
	lcd_struct *pp; after successful close we have *pp = NULL
	returns 0 on success;
	returns a negative errno code on failure;

linux > 2.2.0:
- ssize_t lcd_write(struct lcd_struct *p, const void *buffer, size_t length, loff_t offset, unsigned int with_attr)
linux < 2.2.0:
- int lcd_write(struct lcd_struct *p, const void *buffer, int length, loff_t offset, unsigned int with_attr)
	write up to "length" bytes from the buffer "buffer" to the LCD display
	described by the struct *p as returned by lcd_open(), starting  at
	offset "offset"; "buffer" is a void * pointer, that may be treated
	either as a unsigned short * ("with_attr" != 0) or  unsigned char *
	("with_attr == 0"); if ("with_attr" != 0) then lcd_write() will also
	consider the attributes of the character being written
	On success the numbers of characters written are returned (zero
	indicates nothing was written).
	On error the appropriate negative errno code is returned.

linux > 2.2.0:
- ssize_t lcd_read(struct lcd_struct *p, void *buffer, size_t length, loff_t offset, unsigned int with_attr)
linux < 2.2.0:
- int lcd_read(struct lcd_struct *p, void *buffer, int length, loff_t offset, unsigned int with_attr)
	attempt to read up to "length" bytes from the LCD display described by
	the struct *p as returned by lcd_open(), into the buffer "buffer"
	starting at offset "offset"; "buffer" is a void * pointer, that may be
	treated either as a unsigned short * ("with_attr" != 0) or  unsigned
	char * ("with_attr == 0"); if ("with_attr" != 0) then lcd_read() will
	also read the attributes of the character being read	
	On success the numbers of characters read are returned (zero indicates
	nothing was read).
	On error the appropriate negative errno code is returned.

- int lcd_ioctl(struct lcd_struct *p, unsigned int ioctl_command, ...)
	lcd_ioctl executes the ioctl with number "ioctl_command" and an optional 
	parameter "ioctl_param", sending commands to the LCD display described
	by the struct *p as returned by lcd_open(); 
	currently the following ioctls are supported:

	LCDL_SET_PARAM		set the parameters contained in the struct
				lcd_driver and reset the device
				typeof (ioctl_param) = struct lcd_driver *

	LCDL_GET_PARAM		get the current parameters into the struct
				lcd_driver
				typeof (ioctl_param) = struct lcd_driver *

	LCDL_RESET_CHARMAP	reset the character map to a one to one
				correspondence with the controller character map
				no parameters
				cannot fail (always return 0)

	LCDL_CHARSUBST		perform character mapping
				typeof (ioctl_param) = unsigned char [2]
				ioctl_param[0] = the original character to be
						 substituted
				ioctl_param[1] = the new character that
						 substitutes the old one
				cannot fail (always return 0)

	LCDL_SAVE_CHARMAP	save the current character map
				no parameters
				cannot fail (always return 0)

	LCDL_RESTORE_CHARMAP	restore a previously saved character map
				no parameters
				cannot fail (always return 0)

	LCDL_SWAP_CHARMAP	exchange the current character map with a
				previously saved one
				no parameters
				cannot fail (always return 0)

	LCDL_RAW_MODE		enter raw mode: characters are directly sent to
				the display, only charmap translation but no
				control character interpretation is performed
				typeof (ioctl_param) = unsigned long
				ioctl_param != 0 ---> RAW mode
				ioctl_param == 0 ---> NORMAL mode
				cannot fail (always return 0)

	LCDL_CLEAR_DISP		clear the display
				no parameters
				cannot fail (always return 0)

	LCDL_SET_CGRAM_CHAR	create new characters using the cgram;
				the number of bytes to write is in the
				lcd_parameters definition of the driver;
				typeof (ioctl_param) = unsigned char *
				ioctl_param[0] = index of the cgram character
				ioctl_param+1 = the buffer to read from

	LCDL_GET_CGRAM_CHAR	read characters from the cgram; the number
				of bytes to read is in the lcd_parameters
				definition of the driver;
				typeof (ioctl_param) = unsigned char *
				ioctl_param[0] = index of the cgram character
				ioctl_param+1 = the buffer to write to

	LCDL_SET_CHARMAP	copy 256 bytes from the buffer pointed by
				ioctl_param into the internal charmap
				typeof (ioctl_param) = unsigned char *

	LCDL_GET_CHARMAP	copy 256 bytes from the internal charmap into
				the buffer pointed by ioctl_param
				typeof (ioctl_param) = unsigned char *

	LCDL_MEMSET		memset for lcd operations:
				set 'ioctl_param[2]' characters to the
				supplied value 'ioctl_param[1]' starting at
				offset 'ioctl_param[0]'
				typeof (ioctl_param) = int [3]
				ioctl_param[0] = destination offset on the lcd
				ioctl_param[1] = character with attributes
				ioctl_param[2] = number of characters to write

	LCDL_MEMMOVE		memmove for lcd operations:
				move 'ioctl_param[2]' characters from offset
				'ioctl_param[1]' to offset 'ioctl_param[0]' in
				a non destructive way; offsets may overlap;
				typeof (ioctl_param) = int [3]
				ioctl_param[0] = destination offset on the lcd
				ioctl_param[1] = source offset on the lcd
				ioctl_param[2] = number of characters to move

	LCDL_IOATTR		allow input/output of attributes:
				when ioctl_param != 0 each character is followed
				by the corresponding attribute both in reading
				and writing operations
				typeof (ioctl_param) = unsigned long
				ioctl_param == 0 ---> only characters
				ioctl_param != 0 ---> characters and attributes

	other ioctl calls are passed to the lcd driver by calling
	handle_custom_ioctl()  (if defined)

	returns 0 on success;
	returns a negative errno code on failure.

The last two fields are present only when using Linux 2.2.0 or later.

"Mandatory" means that the function MUST be defined for the lcd-linux layer to
work properly. If the function does not apply to your case, define an empty
function.

"Optional" means that the lcd-linux layer uses this function only if it is
defined. If not either a built-in replacement is used or the function is
skipped.
