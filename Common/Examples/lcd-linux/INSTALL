In order to compile LCD-Linux you need a full distribution of the kernel
sources. The sources must be configured, so if you just downloaded a fresh
kernel source package, remember to unpack it, do a "make xconfig" and compile a
new kernel. Some include files will be created in the right places, reflecting
your current configuration.

To compile lcd-linux and related drivers do

	make

in the main directory. Modules will be placed in the "modules" directory.
To install them do a "make install".

To compile some example programs do

	make test

in the main directory.

To compile the kernel console driver do

	make lcdcon

in the main directory. Modules will be placed in the "modules" directory. Since
this module is experimental it is not installed by default. You have to install
it by hand. Be sure to load all the required modules before loading lcdcon or
your system will crash!!! To be more specific, you have to load lcd-linux and
hd44780 modules (both of them) BEFORE loading the lcdcon module. You have been
warned!!!!


Have Fun!
