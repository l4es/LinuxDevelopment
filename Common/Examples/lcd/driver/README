Hardware
--------
This is for a 20 x 4 character LCD display based on the Hitachi HD44780
controller. Additional displays with other geometries should be suppported by
setting LCD_COLS and LCD_LINES correctly. The display can easily be wired to
a standard PC parallel port. Just connect the eight data bits to the eight
inputs of the display plus STROBE (pin 1 on 25 pin Sub-D) to EN (enable) and
FEED (pin 14 on 25 pin Sub-D) to RS (command-/datamode). You will also have
to connect GND to the read/write selector input. The driver does not need to
read from the display so we can hard-wire the write mode. Don't forget to add
at least one GND line. The +5V power supply for the display can easily be
obtained from a game-port adapter or drive power supply connector.

        14		RS	4

Pin 3 on the LCD is the LCD driver control voltage input, i.e. contrast
regulation. My display shows very good contrast when wired directly to
GND. Other display may need a real driver current. You can use a
variable resistor (>= 20 kOhm) to do it like this

  +5V ---+
         /
         \ <--+
         /    |
         \    |
  GND ---+    +--- VL (Pin 3 - driver input)

The PC game port offers several +5V lines that can be used as power supply.
You can use
  DB15 pins 1,8,9 or 15 for +5V
            4,5 or 12   for GND

But please try to verify this for your hardware because some soundcards may
carry additional signals like a Midi port on those lines.
A floppy or harddisk power connector serves also as power supply. Here use
the red wire (+5V) and the black wire (GND). CAUTION: The yellow wire
carries +12V which would toast your display immediately and may also damage
your parallel port!


Installation / compilation
--------------------------
Choose the correct definition for Kernel 2.0.* or Kernel 2.1.* (use
  -DKERNEL21 for Kernel 2.2.* too). For kernel 2.4 set this to
  -DKERNEL21 -DKERNEL24

Now just type 'make' to build the module.

Create a character device major 120 minor 0, you may choose to use the
included script 'mkdevice' for this which creates /dev/lcd.

'insmod' the module without any options if you want the defaults:
  I/O address     0x378 (first parallel port on most PCs)
  Columns            20
  Lines               4
  Short timing       40
  Long timing       100
  Addressing type     0 (HD44780 and compatible controllers)

You can override them with these parameters: 
  io      for io_address of the parallel port 
  cols    for number of columns:  Only 16,20,24,32 and 40 are valid
  lines   for number of lines: Only 1,2 and 4 are valid
  t_short Short Display Timing. Standard is:  40
  t_long  Long Display Timing.  Standard is: 100
  a_type  Addressing type. Standard is: 0. Possible values are 0 for standard
          HD44780 controller types and 1 for HD66712 controllers.
  w_mode  Allows to use the winamp style wiring using w_mode=1,
          w_mode=0 selects the original style (default)
 
The device is initialized (set initial mode, clear display, turn display on)
when the driver module is inserted. You should see an underline cursor not
blinking in the upper left corner.

Now just write text to the device, done ;)
German "Umlaut" characters are mapped correctly. Additional mappings can be
done in "c_table.h".

Valid ESC commands:
  ESC c   - Clear display
  ESC h   - Home cursor
  ESC R   - Reset display
  ESC b   - Cursor on and blinking
  ESC B   - Cursor on, not blinking
  ESC k   - Cursor on, not blinking
  ESC K   - Cursor off
  ESC g   - Goto xy
  ESC #   - Define user definable char number # (characters #0 to #7)


Defining a character:
---------------------
Characters are organized in 8 bits per row (!) with the three most
significant bits ignored for displays with 5x7 fonts and 8 rows per
character. Some displays can also use 5x8 fonts, i.e. the characters may use
the cursor line. A character is defined as follows:

	D7----D0
  0	00011111 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1		= 31
  1	00010000				= 16
  2	00010001 = 16 + 1			= 17
  3	00011111 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1		= 31
  4	00010001 = 16 + 1			= 17
  5	00010000				= 16
  6	00010000				= 16
  7	00000000				= 0

which creates something similar to a big F.
To define this character as char number 0 you will have to write the sequence

  27 0 31 16 17 31 17 16 16 0

to the LCD device (which is ESC-0-31-16-17-31-17-16-16-0).
You can do this from your shell using the echo command with the "-e" switch
like in
  echo -n -e "\33\0\37\20\21\37\21\20\20\0" > /dev/lcd
A subsequent
  echo -n -e "\0" > /dev/lcd
will print the new character. The "-n" just suppresses a trailing line-feed.


Terminal-like behaviour:
------------------------
If during the cursor reaches the right most character during a write the
cursor is positioned at the beginning of the next line.

Line-feed character (dec 10) causes the cursor to move to the beginning of
the next line.

Carriage-return (dec 13) causes the cursor to move to the beginning of the
current line.


Further installation
--------------------
If you use something like kerneld, i.e. automatically loading modules when
needed, you might want to copy the driver 'lcd.o' to your modules directory
and add the following line to your 'conf.modules'

  alias char-major-120 lcd

After that update your module's dependencies by doing 'depmod -a' and the
module should load automatically when /dev/lcd is accessed.


Testing
-------
You should have received some test programs with this package. After the
display is installed and the module is inserted correctly you should be able
to run them and see the output.
  test/
	type 'make' to build a program 'dtest'
	running './dtest' will at first display a sequence of "12345..." in
	every line so you can count the number of characters ;) After pressing
	a key the whole font is displayed filling the whole screen with one
	character each and going through all characters >=32.
  tools/scripts/
	nice		- prints date, time and system-load every ten seconds,
			  a simple demo for a shell script
  tools/defchars/
	horbars		- simple shell script that defines horizontal bargraph
			  characters
	vertbars	- simple shell script that defines vertical bargraph
			  characters
	printchars	- simple shell script that prints the eight user definable
			  characters
  tools/proclcd/
	proclcd		- C program to print date, time and system load on the display
			  (if you want something like this use 'proclcd' not 'nice')


Usual blah-blah
---------------
This driver is incomplete and may crash your machine.
Wrong wiring may also cause severe damage to the display and to your
computer. There is also no expressed or implied waranty that it will work with
your display your computer or both.

The driver is free software but
